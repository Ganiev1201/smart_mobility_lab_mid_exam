## Step 1: Turtle installation
<br />

As always, start by sourcing your setup files in a new terminal

<br />

~~~
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
~~~

<br />

First we need to make sure our software is up to date

<br />

~~~
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-humble-turtlesim
~~~

<br />

## Install and Run

<br />

After finishing that things we can run turtle

<br />

~~~
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_node
~~~

<br />

for the moving the tortle by using arrow keys we should give a code bellow
~~~
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
~~~
<br />

You can see the nodes and their associated services, topics, and actions  "using"  the list command:
~~~
ros2 node list
ros2 topic list
ros2 service list
ros2 action list
~~~

<br />

### Step 3 installing rqt

<br />

For the running rqt we need code bellow 
~~~
rqt
~~~
<br />
When you run rqt for the first time window will be blank. but no need to worry you just go **Plugins > Services > Service Caller from the menu bar at the top.**
<br />

<br />

Use the refresh button to the left of the Service dropdown list to ensure all the services of your turtlesim node are available.

<br />

## step 4 spawn service

<br />

We can create another turtle using the RQT tool. In order to do that, we should go to the tab Plugins > Services > Service cellar. Then, choose /spawn from the dropdown options and give a name and coordinates for our second turtle.

<br />

If you return to the terminal where turtle_teleop_key is running and press the arrow keys, you will see turtle1â€™s pen has changed.
